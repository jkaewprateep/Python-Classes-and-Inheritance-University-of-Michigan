## Understand the assignment #1 Puzzles guessing word character from a random fortune-wheel with computer player ##

üß∏üí¨ There are human player and computer player, start the game with an amount of money 0$, and the goal is to guess characters in word composing. The games is playing as a turn-based game each player has to spin the wheel and define an amount for each turn with valid of three actions (1) Guessing a letter that does not mean guessing in the game and the minimum prize for the vowel is at least 250$ the game turn play will return the prize to the player in turn by the number of character guessing correct times the prizes of money the player determined in each turn base. (2) Guess to win the game by each turn and correct phase to win the games and (3) Turn pass by say pass.

### Select random text ###

üß∏üí¨ Selecting random text by utilizing randoms function, this implementation is when over start the running project but for random instant required to a specific random number or create a random identity to tell random sample of a new random object. </br>
üëßüí¨ üéà Implementation in an open environment will require random functions because of environment adjustment and boost learning faster in the development area. Learning function and perform immediately but as in open environment problem to create a smooth response and evaluation random function still required similar to a bouncing ball on the floor the basketball players can play it but warm-up methods allowed them to play better with a confidence level. </br>

```
import random

rand_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print('Random number between 1 and 10: {}'.format(rand_number))

letters = [letter for letter in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ']
rand_letter = random.choice(letters)
print('Random letter: {}'.format(rand_letter))
```

üß∏üí¨ We‚Äôre going to define a few useful methods for you:  </br>
        (1) getNumberBetween(prompt, min, max)) validate number of prompts input and minimum and maximum values.  </br>
        (2) spinWheel() simulates spinning the wheel and returns a dictionary with a random prize.  </br>
        (3) getRandomCategoryAndPhrase() returns a tuple with a random category and phrase for players to guess  </br>
        (4) obscurePhrase(phrase, guessed) returns a tuple with a random category and phrase for players to guess  </br>

```

## Part A: WOFPlayer ##

üêëüí¨ ‚û∞ We define the player instance for the collection of these values as a class name ```WOFPlayer```. </br>
    ```.name```: The name of the player (should be passed into the constructor) </br>
    ```.prizeMoney```: The amount of prize money for this player (an integer, initialized to 0) </br>
    ```.prizes```: The prizes this player has won so far (a list, initialized to []) </br>
    
#### WOFPlayer class methods ####

```.addMoney(amt)```: Add amt to self.prizeMoney </br>
```.goBankrupt()```: Set self.prizeMoney to 0 </br>
```.addPrize(prize)```: Append prize to self.prizes </br>
```.__str__()```: Returns the player‚Äôs name and prize money in the following format: </br>
Steve ($1800) (for a player with instance variables .name == 'Steve' and prizeMoney == 1800)

#### Example of WOFPlayer class ####

```
class WOFPlayer():
    
    def __init__( self, name ):
        self.name = name;
        
        self.prizes = None;

        message = f"{ self.name } (${ self.prizeMoney })"

## Part B: WOFHumanPlayer ##

üêëüí¨ ‚û∞ This WOFHumanPlayer is inherited from WOFPlayer class with a method ```.getMove(category, obscuredPhrase, guessed)``` for the input of the player guess word character as in the next text display example. </br>

### Sample output ###

```

Phrase: _L___ER N____N_L P_RK
Guessed: B, E, K, L, N, P, R, X, Z

Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':
