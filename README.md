### Select random text ###

ðŸ§¸ðŸ’¬ Selecting random text by utilizing randoms function, this implementation is when over start the running project but for random instant required to a specific random number or create a random identity to tell random sample of a new random object. </br>

```
import random

rand_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print('Random number between 1 and 10: {}'.format(rand_number))

letters = [letter for letter in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ']
rand_letter = random.choice(letters)
print('Random letter: {}'.format(rand_letter))
```
